I think it's quite evident I'm not much of a blogger, I mean, three years is a bit of long time to wait for new content. I remember first starting this little 'portfolio' site of mine, with an enthusiastic mindset full of lots of little code snippets and waxing philosophical in long winded blog posts about tech, and perhaps even sharing insights into my personal life and some of my other interests that keep me busy.

So what happened?

Well, in short, life happened. Not long after my last post here my life took a drastic turn. I wont go into the details but over the last three years I have experienced so much - both good and bad - that I just didn't find the space to take some time to update this site. Thats not to say I haven't still been learning, on the contrary, I've worked in some of the best roles in my professional career over the last three years. I've just had so much on that things like updating sites just sat on the back burner.

So why decide to start now?

That's a difficult one, and again is probably wrapped up in some stuff that's going on in my life at the minute. Anyone who knows me will know I've bee through the mill a bit, especially in the last couple of months. I think I'm looking to find as many positive outlets in my life that I can at the minute, and if that means writing bits of code here and there, and sharing the knowledge I have about programming then I think that's my reason right there.

So what next?

Well, I've certainly picked up a lot of new skills. I've worked on some interesting projects so I'll maybe be looking at sharing something alogn those lines. One thing I am dead set on though is posting those little code snippets you get from time to time, you know those ones where you've had like 20 tabs open on chrome and it's taken you the best part of the afternoon to really nail down something. Yeah, I reckon I'll start with those.
